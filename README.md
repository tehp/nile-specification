Decentralized, commission-free, local-economy focused Amazon alternative
## Why?
We live in a society in which huge corporations have the power to influence economies and trends. Today Amazon is the leading company for selling goods across the web, they don’t pay taxes, they underpay their employees, and they are disrupting local economies. We think that the world deserves a better alternative, so we decide to found Nile.
## What is Nile?
Nile is a decentralized ecommerce that promotes local stores, and it’s commission free: all the money you pay for a good goes directly to the seller. Nile is made to be, as far as possible, similar to Amazon; so, when you are searching for something, you’ll not even notice that you are using a decentralized system.
## How will you earn money?
The application is decentralized so we just need money for the developers, the lawyers and the advertisers, we don’t have to build and maintain a huge and expansive network infrastructure. So we’ll just earn money from advertisement, but it will not be specific for you, because we want your data to be yours, and we will accept to advertise only local products.
##How do you build a decentralized ecommerce?
Every city (or village) will have a Nile instance, the Nile instance is needed to group all the stores of your city so you can view them in a showcase like Amazon’s. All the Nile instances will talk to each other, so when you search for a product and it’s not near to you (it means it’s not in the instance of your city), you will find it anyway.
Stores will also contribute to the platform: every store will host its part of the system: when you buy a product, the computational cost of the operation is processed by the store. The store will have different ways to connect to the local Nile instance, if a store doesn’t handle lots of requests then it just need a browser to be part of the network. If the store needs to handle thousands of requests per seconds then a more powerful architecture is needed but we will help configuring it.
## What about the delivery?
Nile comes with a delivery service that works like Deliveroo: a network of cyclist that cover the local area. An algorithm calculates the best and cheapest route to deliver your goods.
Also the delivery service will be commission-free, when a good is delivered, the money for the delivery goes directly to the cyclists involved.
When you buy something from far away a cyclist can’t do the job, so the app will suggest the cheapest delivery method from a third party delivery service.
